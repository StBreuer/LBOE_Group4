Don't know how to query for Datatypes
maybe define new datatype that matches what I want?
but anyways ... 
I want to know how large the makibox is therefore I query for the box that is part of the makibox (makibox is a dish maybe make it a box as well)

isPartOf some (Dish and (hasPart some {Avocadomaki}))
