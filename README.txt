I'm sorry that I didnt do alot I had some other stuff to fix
I added a new concept for food attributes to encapsulate all these random attribute classes.
I think its kinda a good idea and may can be done to the restaurant stuff too.
I may be online on some point and add some more Individuals to the Ontologie
