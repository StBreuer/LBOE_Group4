CHANGELOG:
- add example Origen not in Japan (doesn't work)
- change hasPart to not transitive/reflexiv and theirfore added hasPartNondirect
- add some more Individuals and Classes
- add questions file
- add isPartOf (inverse of hasPart)

CHANGELOG:
- fixed terminology, added ingredients and classes
- menus would be best taken care of just as sets of Restaurant -> serves -> Dish 
- dishes are the meals with utensils, the entrees on the menu (that have a price, weight, and so on)
- the concept of 
- I didn't 
- Spiciness is a DataProperty now, the Spicy category is a subset of Spicy food, Hot is smt with spiciness at least 4 (but I do ), medium 2-3 (but I didn't find a working way now how to define this)
- we have to fix the complements somehow (the Vegan, Vegetarian stuff reasoning doesn't work)
- I've added Mayo as an example for testing, it's probably the most "complicated" individual yet

---

I'm sorry that I didnt do alot I had some other stuff to fix
I added a new concept for food attributes to encapsulate all these random attribute classes.
I think its kinda a good idea and may can be done to the restaurant stuff too.
I may be online on some point and add some more Individuals to the Ontologie
